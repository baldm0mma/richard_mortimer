## Test Coverage

## Description

This project is Rick and Morty fan app. With the announcement of R&M Season 4 coming this fall, there's a lot of excitement around it's hottly anticipated release. This app is designed to be a endorsement piece; an attempt to keep up the excitement for the upcoming season. There's a bit of gamification, a bit of shameless plugging of Adult Swim, and a LOT of 80's computer styling.

## Project Successes

This project actually has quite a bit going on behind the scenes. Fetching, typewriter fonts, react-router, 404 error warnings, redux, both functional and class React components, external linking to curated google searches, sorting, filtering, seaching, enzyme testing, etc. But with all of that happening in the background, I think my biggest success was making everything actually WORK together. With so macny moving parts, it felt like a real accomplishment to actually pull everything together.

## Project Challenges

As always, writing modular code required careful planning and strategic architecture. This was also true for my Redux store. Thinking critically about what needed to live in the Redux store vs. local state is always a challenge, as there are pros and cons to both. But in the end, I intentionally sent most data to the store, as not needing local state could keep my components and containers as small and DRY as possible.
